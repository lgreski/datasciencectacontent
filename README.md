# Data Science Specialization Community Mentor Content Repository

Author: Len Greski

This repository contains content developed during my time as either a student or Community Mentor in the Data Science Specialization from Johns Hopkins University that is offered over [Coursera](http://coursera.org). A number of people have developed content to help students work through the ten courses in the specialization. The main index for this content is [datasciencespecialization.github.io](http://datasciencespecialization.github.io/).


# Repository Contents

As a participant and Community Mentor in courses in the curriculum, there are patterns of similar issues experienced by students. Migrating the content to github will facilitate reposting it to new runs of courses within the curriculum. This will make it easier for students to have access to the experiences from prior students without me having to regularly cut and paste content from past sessions into Discussion Forums, which are the primary mechanism for communication between students and Community Mentors.

## Course 1: Data Scientist's Toolbox

1. [Course Prerequisites and Difficulty Levels](http://bit.ly/2e6y3nn) Provides an overview of the Data Science Specialization courses, explaining from a practical perspective the courses a student needs as prerequisites to other courses. While students may take more than one class at a time, it's important to know how information from earlier courses is used in subsequent ones. <br><br> The article also ranks the difficulty levels from most to least difficult, based on the author's experience in the curriculum as well as Discussion Forum feedback contributed by other students.

### Issue: Students Struggle to find URLs in Lecture Slides

If you're interested in the URLs for the lecture slides, they are available in the [Data Science Specialization Courses](http://bit.ly/2bJcXNW) github repository. Each course is stored in a subdirectory within the repository, and the slides are built in R Markdown language, a technique you'll learn in *Developing Data Products*.
