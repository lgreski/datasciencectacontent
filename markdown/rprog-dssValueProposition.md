# Data Science Specialization: What's the Value? 

By the first or second week into *R Programming*, students in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization often express frustration about the degree to which they have to figure things out on their own in order to complete quizzes and course assignments. This frustration usually comes in the form of forum posts, many of which generate large volumes of "me too" replies.

# Value of the Specialization

One of the major components of the Data Science Specialization is the hacker mentality described in the *Data Scientist's Toolbox*. The Specialization classes are highly condensed versions of Johns Hopkins classes that cost $3,310 USD each \(as of fall 2016\).

In my view, here's what a student gets for the $49 USD \(as of January 2017\) for one course:

* A set of lectures that describe the topic, about 45 - 60 minutes per week \(except for the Capstone, where the lectures are 1 - 3 minutes per week due to the fact that it is the ultimate embodiment of the *hacker mentality*\), <br><br>
* A set of slides accompanying the lectures that students can use for reference,<br><br>
* Guidance on how to leverage outside resources to learn things that aren't directly taught in the course, <br><br>
* A set of exercises that push students  to figure out how to do things of practical value to a data scientist, beyond "trivial" examples,<br><br>
* A set of quizzes that require students to use what has been covered in the lectures to confirm understanding of the material,<br><br>
* A set of course projects that challenge students to produce legitimate work products that can be showcased in a portfolio, and <br><br>
* Access to a community of students, mentors, and high quality [community-generated content](http://bit.ly/2ePZxfk) that provides context beyond what is covered in the lectures, built by people who have already taken the Specialization courses, some of whom are practicing data scientists or who manage teams of data scientists. <br><br>

The bottom line is that the Data Science Specialization provides access to content from a prestigious U.S. university at a very affordable price, even if there is a lot less hand holding than is typical for a course in meat space at a university.

Furthermore, since the Specialization uses the open source language R, students also learn how to use very sophisticated statistics software at a fraction of the cost of commercial statistics packages, as I discuss in [Commercial Statistics Packages: An Historical Perspective](http://bit.ly/2fPj2qN).

# "Difficulty" is Relative to One's Experience

Often, students new to data science lack perspective of the challenges in learning one statistics language versus another. The Specialization attracts many students who may have had one or more undergraduate or graduate statistics courses, including exposure to statistics software such as SPSS or SAS. Usually the programming problems in these courses are very easy, leading students to three problems when they start the Data Science Specialization:

1. An over-optimistic sense of one's skill level in a statistics language, <br><br>
2. An unrealistic [expectation that R should work like the statistics language the student previously learned](http://bit.ly/2cH3u8x), and <br><br>
2. Frustration that R is much more difficult than the language they learned in statistics class.

Helping students overcome these frustrations requires exposure to additional information to provide context against which their experiences can be compared. I have written a few articles to address these issues, including:

* [Thinking in R versus Thinking in SAS](http://bit.ly/2cH3u8x), which illustrates how one's exposure to a statistics package affects how s/he thinks about solving problems, contrasting SAS and R. <br><br>
* [Why is R Harder than SAS](http://bit.ly/2erxk3A) explains why students with a SAS backround perceive R to be significantly more difficult than SAS. <br><br>
* [A SAS Version of pollutantmean()](http://bit.ly/2d3DR4e)  addresses the relative complexity of SAS versus R on an equal task -- implementation of the *R Programming* `pollutantmean()` function. <br><br>

# You: The Final Ingredient

The Specialization courses provide everything one needs to direct one's learning in data science at an affordable price. The final ingredient is the student's motivation and determination to solve problems. Yes, the introductory assignments in *R Programming* are a big jump in difficulty from the lectures. Yes, the course projects for *Getting and Cleaning Data*, *Reproducible Research*, and *Practical Machine Learning* are very challenging. Yes, the mathematics in *Statistical Inference* and *Regression Models* are tough for students who haven't previously studied statistics.

On the other hand, the Specialization presents an opportunity for students to produce some outstanding quality deliverables for their portfolios, solving challenging problems that relate well to real world work in data science.

After all, that's what Data Science in real life is all about: ambiguous problems, messy data, scores of algorithms to consider, and limited computer resources that challenge the Data Scientist to produce actionable results within an acceptable cost structure. By the end of the Specialization a student has figured out how to learn about a tough topic, developed a level of self-sufficiency to tackle ambiguous problems, and produced deliverables that are worthy of sharing with potential employers for entry level data science jobs.
